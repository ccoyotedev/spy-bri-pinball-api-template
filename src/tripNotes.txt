Scenes
	- make sure to add a scene config and pass into class' super
	- make sure to reference a scene's config's name when changing scenes
	- make sure to add any new scenes AFTER the boot scene import in scenes' folder's index.ts file, because Phaser is imported from it.
	- scene.start = stops the current one and starts the next one
	- scene.launch = run the target scene in parallel with current scene

Connecting to game
